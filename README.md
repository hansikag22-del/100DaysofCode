✨ Daily Challenge – 100 Days of Code (UPES) ✨

100 Days of Code – C Language Learning Challenge 

This is Day 1 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, dedicated entirely to learning and mastering the C programming language. Over the next several weeks, I’m committing to writing code every day, improving my problem-solving abilities, and strengthening my understanding of core programming concepts.


My learning plan includes:
• Understanding C fundamentals and syntax
• Working with variables, operators, and control statements
• Building functions and exploring recursion
• Mastering arrays, strings, pointers, and structures
• Learning about dynamic memory allocation
• Exploring file handling and modular programming
• Solving daily coding problems to sharpen logic

By documenting everything publicly, I aim to stay consistent, accountable, and motivated. I hope this journey not only helps me grow but also inspires others who are learning to code. If you're also on a similar path, let’s connect and support one another.

Here’s to 100 days of learning, coding, improving, and becoming a better programmer.
